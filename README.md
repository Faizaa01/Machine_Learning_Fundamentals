# Machine Learning Practice

This repository contains my **practice-based revision of core Machine Learning concepts**, following a structured ML course curriculum.
This repo exists to **revisit, reinforce, and implement** the concepts properly through hands-on coding and problem solving.

The focus is on:
- Conceptual clarity
- Mathematical intuition
- Practical implementation using Python
- Building a solid end-to-end ML foundation

All notebooks are created and run using **Google Colab**.

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository is **for learning and revision purposes**.

The goal is to:
- Strengthen fundamentals
- Translate theory into working code
- Build confidence in ML concepts through practice
- Create a well-organized reference for future use

This is not production-level code.  
Correctness, clarity, and understanding are prioritized.

## Status
🚧 In Progress  
Actively revising and practicing ML concepts over a short intensive period.

New notebooks are added as practice is completed.
